# PokerChipCalculator
This JavaFX and Scene builder application allows users to calculate the amount of chips to hand out to start a poker game. I made this application for the academic conference at MSUM. The purpose of this code is to take in all of the user variables like the 5 chip colors they have in their set, what those colors are worth for the game, and how many of each color are in the set. The two main focuses of this project are the GUI manipulation and the actual algorithm I wrote to get the correct output.

# All of the code I wrote for the project is in PokerFinal/src/sample/controller.java

# The start of the GUI screen the user sees on running the program is in firstGUI.PNG
